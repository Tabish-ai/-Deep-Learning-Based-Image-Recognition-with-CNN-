📌 Project Title
CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Deep Learning (CNNs)

📖 Project Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories:
🚀 Airplane, 🚗 Automobile, 🐦 Bird, 🐱 Cat, 🦌 Deer, 🐶 Dog, 🐸 Frog, 🐴 Horse, 🚢 Ship, and 🚚 Truck.

CNNs are deep learning models designed specifically for image recognition. They work by extracting features from images through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to make accurate predictions.

📊 Dataset: CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in computer vision, containing:

60,000 images (32x32 pixels, RGB)
10 classes (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck)
50,000 training images & 10,000 test images
Preloaded in TensorFlow/Keras, so no need to download separately.
📥 Dataset Source: CIFAR-10 Dataset on Kaggle


🚀 Technologies Used
✔️ Python
✔️ TensorFlow / Keras
✔️ NumPy
✔️ Matplotlib
✔️ Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook


🏋️ Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

3 Convolutional Layers (Extracts features like edges, textures, shapes)
MaxPooling Layers (Reduces image size while keeping important details)
Flatten Layer (Converts 2D image features to 1D)
Fully Connected Dense Layers (Final decision-making)
Softmax Activation (Predicts probabilities for each class)

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32,32,3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
🎯 Results & Accuracy
📊 Training Accuracy: ~85-90%
📊 Test Accuracy: ~75-85%

Example image prediction:

Input Image	Predicted	Actual
Cat ✅	Cat ✅
Automobile ✅	Automobile ✅
📌 Improvements & Next Steps
🔹 Train for more epochs to improve accuracy.
🔹 Use Data Augmentation to make the model generalize better.
🔹 Try Transfer Learning with a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).
